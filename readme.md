# yarr

**yarr** (yet another rss reader) is a web-based feed aggregator which can be used both
as a desktop application and a personal self-hosted server.

It is written in Go with the frontend in Vue.js. The storage is backed by SQLite.

## changes in this fork

- A ctrl-p-like finder for feeds
- Tagging of feeds
- Improved item-feed navigation
- Use localstorage for most options as opposed to the default server-sided storage
- Filter rules to filter-out items matching a regex
- Various small modifications to match my personal preference
